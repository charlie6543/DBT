                    <strong>People are doing the best they can.</strong><br>
                    <p>All people at any given point in time are doing the best they can.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>People want to improve.</strong>
                    <p>The common characteristic of all people is that 
                        they want to improve their lives and be happy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>People need to do better, try harder, and be more 
                        motivated to change.*</strong>
                    <p>The fact that people are doing the best they can, and want to do
                        even better, does not mean that these things are enough to solve
                        the problem.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>People may not have caused all of their own problems, but they
                        have to solve them anyway.**</strong>
                    <p>People have to change their own behavioral responses and alter their
                        environment for their life to change.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>New behavior has to be learned in all relevant contexts.</strong>
                    <p>New behavioral skills have to be practiced in the situations where the
                        skills are needed, not just in the situation where the skills are
                        first learned.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>All behaviors (actions, thoughts, emotions) are caused.</strong>
                    <p>There is always a cause or set of causes for our actions, thoughts, 
                        and emotions, even if we do not know what the causes are.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Figuring out and changing the causes of behavior work better
                        than judging and blaming.
                    </strong>
                    <p>Judging and blaming are easier, but if we want to create change in the
                        world, we have to change the chains of events that cause unwanted behaviors
                        and events.

                </li>
            </ol>

            <small>*But trying harder and being more motivated may not be needed if progress
                is steady and at a realistic rate of improvement.
